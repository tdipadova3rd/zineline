        Zineline represents every NFT you've ever held. It shows acquisition
        (mint, receipt, buy) with ðŸŒœ and release (sale, transfer, burn) with ðŸŒ›.
        Soon you will be able to change these values to experiment with
        "what-if". What if I joined the project earlier? What if I held longer?
        There will also be features to show portfolio value at various times.
        More metrics coming soon.

        Data not showing up or looks off? You're probably being rate limited.
